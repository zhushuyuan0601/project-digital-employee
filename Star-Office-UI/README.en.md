# Star Office UI

🌐 Language: [中文](./README.md) | **English** | [日本語](./README.ja.md)

![Star Office UI Cover](docs/screenshots/readme-cover-2.jpg)

**A pixel-art AI office dashboard** — visualize your AI assistant's work status in real time, so you can see at a glance who's doing what, what they did yesterday, and whether they're online.

Supports multi-agent collaboration, trilingual UI (CN/EN/JP), AI-powered room design, and desktop pet mode.
Best experienced with [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw), but also works standalone as a status dashboard.

> This project was co-created by **[Ring Hyacinth](https://x.com/ring_hyacinth)** and **[Simon Lee](https://x.com/simonxxoo)**, and is continuously maintained and improved together with community contributors ([@Zhaohan-Wang](https://github.com/Zhaohan-Wang), [@Jah-yee](https://github.com/Jah-yee), [@liaoandi](https://github.com/liaoandi)).
> Issues and PRs are welcome — thank you to everyone who contributes.

## ✨ Quick Start

### Option 1: Let your lobster deploy it (recommended for OpenClaw users)

If you're using [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw), just send this to your lobster:

```text
Please follow this SKILL.md to deploy Star Office UI for me:
https://github.com/ringhyacinth/Star-Office-UI/blob/master/SKILL.md
```

Your lobster will automatically clone the repo, install dependencies, start the backend, configure status sync, and send you the access URL.

### Option 2: 30-second manual setup

> **Requires Python 3.10+** (the codebase uses `X | Y` union type syntax, which is not supported on 3.9 or earlier)

```bash
# 1) Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/ringhyacinth/Star-Office-UI.git
cd Star-Office-UI

# 2) Install dependencies (Python 3.10+ required)
python3 -m pip install -r backend/requirements.txt

# 3) Initialize state file (first run)
cp state.sample.json state.json

# 4) Start the backend
cd backend
python3 app.py
```

Open **http://127.0.0.1:19000** and try switching states:

```bash
python3 set_state.py writing "Organizing documents"
python3 set_state.py error "Found an issue, debugging"
python3 set_state.py idle "Standing by"
```

## 🤔 Who is this for?

### Users with OpenClaw / an AI Agent
This is the **full experience**. Your agent automatically switches status as it works, and the pixel character walks to the corresponding office area in real time — just open the page and see what your AI is doing right now.

### Users without OpenClaw
You can still deploy and use it. You can:
- Use `set_state.py` or the API to push status manually or via scripts
- Use it as a pixel-art personal status page or remote work dashboard
- Connect any system that can send HTTP requests to drive the status

---

## 📋 Features

1. **Status Visualization** — 6 states (`idle` / `writing` / `researching` / `executing` / `syncing` / `error`) mapped to different office areas with animated sprites and speech bubbles
2. **Yesterday Memo** — Automatically reads the latest daily log from `memory/*.md`, sanitizes it, and displays it as a "Yesterday Memo" card
3. **Multi-Agent Collaboration** — Invite other agents to join your office via join keys and see everyone's status in real time
4. **Trilingual UI** — Switch between Chinese, English, and Japanese with one click; all UI text, bubbles, and loading messages update instantly
5. **Custom Art Assets** — Manage characters, scenes, and decorations through the sidebar; dynamic frame sync prevents flickering
6. **AI-Powered Room Design** — Connect your own Gemini API to generate new office backgrounds; core features work fine without an API
7. **Mobile-Friendly** — Open on your phone for a quick status check on the go
8. **Security Hardening** — Sidebar password protection, weak-password blocking in production, hardened session cookies
9. **Flexible Public Access** — Use Cloudflare Tunnel for instant public access, or bring your own domain / reverse proxy
10. **Desktop Pet Mode** — Optional Electron desktop wrapper that turns the office into a transparent desktop widget (see below)

---

## 🚀 Detailed Setup Guide

### 1) Install dependencies

```bash
cd Star-Office-UI
python3 -m pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

### 2) Initialize state file

```bash
cp state.sample.json state.json
```

### 3) Start the backend

```bash
cd backend
python3 app.py
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:19000`

> ✅ For local development you can start with the defaults; in production, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set strong random values for `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` and `ASSET_DRAWER_PASS` to avoid weak passwords and session leaks.

### 4) Switch states

```bash
python3 set_state.py writing "Organizing documents"
python3 set_state.py syncing "Syncing progress"
python3 set_state.py error "Found an issue, debugging"
python3 set_state.py idle "Standing by"
```

### 5) Public access (optional)

```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://127.0.0.1:19000
```

Share the `https://xxx.trycloudflare.com` link with anyone.

### 6) Verify your installation (optional)

```bash
python3 scripts/smoke_test.py --base-url http://127.0.0.1:19000
```

If all checks report `OK`, your deployment is good to go.

## 🦞 OpenClaw Deep Integration

> The following section is for [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) users. If you don't use OpenClaw, feel free to skip this.

### Automatic Status Sync

Add the following rule to your `SOUL.md` (or agent config) so your agent updates its status automatically:

```markdown
## Star Office Status Sync Rules
- When starting a task: run `python3 set_state.py <state> "<description>"` before beginning work
- When finishing a task: run `python3 set_state.py idle "Standing by"` before replying
```

**6 states → 3 office areas:**

| State | Office Area | When to use |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `idle` | 🛋 Breakroom (sofa) | Standing by / task complete |
| `writing` | 💻 Workspace (desk) | Writing code or docs |
| `researching` | 💻 Workspace | Searching / researching |
| `executing` | 💻 Workspace | Running commands / tasks |
| `syncing` | 💻 Workspace | Syncing data / pushing |
| `error` | 🐛 Bug Corner | Error / debugging |

### Invite Other Agents to Your Office

**Step 1: Prepare join keys**

When you start the backend for the first time, if there is no `join-keys.json` in the project root, the service will automatically create one based on `join-keys.sample.json` (which contains an example key such as `ocj_example_team_01`). You can then edit the generated `join-keys.json` to add, modify, or remove keys; by default each key supports up to 3 concurrent users.

**Step 2: Have the guest run the push script**

The guest only needs to download `office-agent-push.py` and fill in 3 variables:

```python
JOIN_KEY = "ocj_starteam02"          # The key you assign
AGENT_NAME = "Alice's Lobster"       # Display name
OFFICE_URL = "https://office.hyacinth.im"  # Your office URL
```

```bash
python3 office-agent-push.py
```

The script auto-joins and pushes status every 15 seconds. The guest will appear on the dashboard, moving to the appropriate area based on their state.

**Step 3 (optional): Guest installs a Skill**

Guests can also use `frontend/join-office-skill.md` as a Skill — their agent will handle setup and pushing automatically.

> See [`frontend/join-office-skill.md`](./frontend/join-office-skill.md) for full guest onboarding instructions.
